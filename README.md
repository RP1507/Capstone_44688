capstone project for MS Data Analytics Program

### Module 1

Introduction was formed. The issue was identified that this project was going to be working with Westminster College Data, and it was going to be used to predict if a Westminster student would be retained or not. The domain was identified as Higher Education. 

### Module 2

Went through the data collection process. Wrote a script to get data from two databases that are specific to my college. Data was exported from the SQL environment into a .csv file.
