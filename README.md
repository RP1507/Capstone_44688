### Module 1

Introduction was formed. The issue was identified that this project was going to be working with Westminster College Data, and it was going to be used to predict if a Westminster student would be retained or not. The domain was identified as Higher Education. 

### Module 2

Went through the data collection process. Wrote a script to get data from two databases that are specific to my college. Data was exported from the SQL environment into a .csv file. 

### Module 3

After the data was collected, the cleaning process took place. Null values were replaced with the average in the numerical columns. Other categories were changed into binary variables, after doing some Exploritory data analysis in the next module, returned to this stage and fixed the outliers for GPA that appeared to be entered incorrectly at 0 for high school.

### Module 4

In this section, exploritory data analysis occured. Several charts such as box plots, histograms, and heat charts were created to get a visual of our data, and see some initial insights and how the features related to each other.

### Module 5

We begin to look at various models for the predictive analysis section. Here we looked at a linear regression model, a decision tree model, a neural net model, and an ADA boosted model. The results were printed along with each model.

### Module 6

In this section, the results are discussed. The best model was chosen which was the ADA Boosted Model. Even though it was the top performing model, it was only successful about two thirds of the time. Some items to think about moving forward are expanding the data set size, as this one had a range of 10 years. Also, would add in financial data from our Financial Aid system such as household income, scholarships received, loans taken out, and other grants. Ideally we would like to see this added in to see if we can get the models performance to increase.
